# :globe_with_meridians: Decentralised Social Platform Built On Hedera
The **Public Social Working Group** was established to address the challenge of building a truly decentralised and open-source social platform â€” one that is neither owned nor controlled by a select few but rather governed collectively by its users. By leveraging the core principles of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT), our mission is to design, innovate, and collaborate on a social ecosystem that prioritizes transparency, user empowerment, interoperability, seamless integration, and community-driven development. A platform **built by the people, for the people.**

### By building on the Hedera network, we leverage fast, secure, and energy-efficient blockchain technology to create a seamless and scalable social experience with predictable, low-cost fees.

## :key:  Key Features:

* **Decentralised governance (DAO)** â€“ Users **collectively govern** the platform.
* **Fair Revenue Sharing** â€“ Content creators, developers, and token holders (those participating in governance) receive **fair rewards**.
* **Interoperability and Open Standards** â€“ Content creators can develop **decentralized apps, tools, and services** that seamlessly integrate with the platform.
* **A social platform that fosters meaningful connections** - Unlike traditional platforms, this platform prioritizes **meaningful connections** over engagement-driven, ad-revenue-maximizing algorithms.
